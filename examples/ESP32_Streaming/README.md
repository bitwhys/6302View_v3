This is only for the files in this immediate directory:

If you'd like to run this whole system locally (do not use an externally hosted site for the GUI), you'll need to install two things for Python. Flask and Flask-CORS. To do that using pip do:

```
pip install flask flask-cors
```

or if you are using pip3

```
pip3 install flask flask-cors
```

Then you can run the file like so:

```
python3 base.py
```

And then go to `localhost:5000` in your browser...this is very similar to how it gets hosted on the remote site.
